<h2> BIOGRAPHY AND FACTS</h2>
<P> Thomas J. Watson, Sr., in full Thomas John Watson, Sr.(born February 17, 1874, Campbell, New York,
     U.S.—died June 19, 1956,New York, New York), Americanindustrialist who built the International 
     Business Machines Corporation (IBM) into the largest manufacturer of electric typewriters and 
     data-processing equipment in the world.
     The son of a lumber dealer, Watson studied at the Elmira(New York) School of Commerce and then 
     worked as a salesman, first in a retail store and then for a small cash register company. In 1895,
     Watson joined the sales staff of the National Cash Register Company in Dayton, Ohio, and he
     eventually rose to the post of general sales manager of the company under the tutelage of its 
     president, John Henry Patterson. In 1912 Patterson involved Watson in anillegal antitrust scheme 
     that resulted in convictions for both men, later overturned. Watson left the National Cash Register 
     in 1913.
     In 1914 Watson became president of the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, a maker of electrical
     punch-card computing systems and other products; the company changed its name to International 
     Business Machines Corporation in 1924. An exceptional salesman and organizer, Watson assembled a 
     highly motivated, well-trained, and well-paid staff. He gave pep talks, enforced a strict dress 
     code, and posted the now famous slogan “Think” in company offices. Coupled with an aggressive 
     research and development program, those efforts enabled IBM to dominate its market. Watson 
     aggressively pursued international trade in the 1930s and ’40s, extending IBM’s virtual monopoly of
     the business machines industry worldwide.In 1952 he turned the IBM presidency over to his son,
     Thomas, Jr., while retaining the post of chairman. By the time of Watson’s death four years later,
     the company (which had 235 employees in 1914) employed 60,000 people and had 200 offices throughout 
     the country, with factories and assembly plants around the world.
     Watson was active in civic affairs and was noted for his efforts on behalf of the arts and world 
     peace. In his honour, his wife started the Thomas J. Watson Foundation in 1961. In 1968 their four 
     children focused the foundation money toward education and world affairs,issues that were of primary
     importance to their father throughout his life, and launched the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship, which
     offered college graduates a one-year grant for independent study and travel outside the United 
     States.
